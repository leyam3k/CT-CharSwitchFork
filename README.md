# CozyTavern Character Switcher (Fork)

A unified quick switcher for characters and groups, conveniently integrated into the chat input bar of SillyTavern/CozyTavern. This fork (CT-CharSwitchFork) reimagines the UI with a purple-ish glassmorphism theme and improved positioning.

## Features

- **Unified Access**: Browse both Characters and Groups in a single, easy-to-navigate list.
- **Smart Views**: Quickly toggle between **Recents** (default), **Favorites**, and **All** entities.
- **Search & Seek**: Instantly filter by name using the search bar or jump to a letter using the A-Z seek bar.
- **Local Randomizer**: Click the dice button (🎲) to instantly switch to a random character from your current filtered view.
- **Integrated Design**: Sits neatly in the chat input bar as a book icon, using a distinct purple theme with glassmorphism effects.
